This is in active development, no stable release currently.
Currently is playable. Terminal resize support still needs to be added.

Run 'doxygen Doxyfile' to create documentation.
Run 'make' to compile the program. GCC > 4.9 must be installed as well as the ncurses library. Code portability through the use of autoconf will be added later.

Play like any other minesweeper program. Use the arrow keys to move (vi movement keys also work) and space/enter to reveal a mine. Use "f" to flag mines.
